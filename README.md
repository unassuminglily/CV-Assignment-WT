# CV-Assignment-WT2020
My submission for the first assignment in the Web technologies class

This assignment is designed for you to practice your HTML, CSS and JavaScript knowledge. You are to model/replicate the Ashesi Career Service CV format/Style using HTML CSS and JavaScript. In this exercise you are not allowed to use any framework, plugin or library. You are to code everything from scratch.

You are free to use your own innovations, but at the minimum, create two separate pages, an external CSS (for styling the form and pages) and external JavaScript (for form validation and data storage).

Index.html page will be a form with the following fields:
First Name
Middle Name
Last Name
Gender: dropdown – ‘male’ and ‘female’
Phone number
Email
Address
 

The above will constitute the dynamic parts of the CV. Meaning, when a user submits the form, the details goes to the second page (cv.html) where the profile sections of the CV is updated with the form data and the rest remains static.

Other sections to be replicated on the CV includes; education background (fixed content), professional experience (fixed content) and all the other sections of an Ashesi CV format (fixed content).

Perform a JavaScript form validation to make sure that the name fields accepts only strings, phone number accepts only numbers and email is a correct format.

As was mentioned in class, read around JavaScript client-side storage and use that or any other means to enable the transfer of form data to the CV.html page (if you access the CV.html page without submitting the form, the profile section will be blank).
